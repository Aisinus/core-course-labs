# C# Best Practices

In the development of the web application, several C# and ASP.NET Core best practices were applied:

1. **Coding Standards**: The code follows the official C# coding conventions. This includes clear and descriptive variable and method names, proper use of access modifiers, and consistent indentation and spacing.

2. **Use of Framework Features**: The code makes use of many features provided by the ASP.NET Core framework, such as dependency injection, routing, and middleware. This ensures that the code is efficient, scalable, and maintainable.

3. **Testing**: The application can be tested by running the application and visiting the appropriate URLs in a web browser. The time displayed should update every second.

4. **Code Quality**: The code quality was ensured by following SOLID principles, keeping the code DRY, and by separating concerns where appropriate. For example, the logic for getting the current time is separated from the logic for updating the UI.

5. **Use of SignalR**: The application uses SignalR to update the time on the client side every second. This is an example of using real-time functionality in a web application, which is a best practice for creating responsive and interactive web applications.
