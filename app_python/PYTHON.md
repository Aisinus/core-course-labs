# Python Best Practices

In the development of the web application, several Python best practices were applied:

1. **Coding Standards**: The code follows PEP 8, the official Python coding standard. This includes clear function names, separation of different sections of the code with blank lines, and inclusion of a main guard clause (`if __name__ == '__main__':`) to prevent the code from being run if the file is imported as a module.

2. **Use of Libraries**: The code makes use of standard Python libraries like datetime and pytz for handling date and time, and Flask for creating the web application. This ensures that the code is efficient and reliable.

3. **Code Structure**: The code is structured in a way that separates different functionalities into different routes and functions. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.

4. **Error Handling**: The code is written in a way that avoids common Python errors. For example, it uses the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard to ensure that the server only runs if the script is run directly, and not if it's imported as a module.

5. **Testing**: The application can be tested by running the script and visiting the appropriate URLs in a web browser.
